# Zote

This gem provides the Fifty-Seven Precents Of Zote in a convenient command-line interface.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add zote

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install zote

## Usage

### Random precept

```shell
$ zote
Precept Six: 'Choose Your Own Fate'. Our elders teach that our fate is chosen for us before we are even born. I disagree.

```

### Specific precept

```shell
$ zote 50
Precept Fifty: 'Don't Linger on Mysteries'. Some things in this world appear to us as puzzles. Or enigmas. If the meaning behind something is not immediately evident though, don't waste any time thinking about it. Just move on.

```
